# movie-manager
An Android app used as my final project for my Mobile Application Programming class which required elements of database management, geolocation, notification, and elements we haven't learned in class like Bottom Navigation which uses Fragments instead of Intents, and using an API.

Movie Manager uses The Movie Databse's API to let users search for any movie and lets them add into a Watch Later or Already Watched list. Watch list keeps a history of the movies that the user wants to watch later, as well as set a reminder for the day. Watch History keeps a history of movies the users have already watched.
